# QEMU Register Extraction

Use this foundational research flow before `qemu-peripheral-modeling` when the source of truth is outside QEMU: OS drivers, bare-metal SDKs, firmware, bootloader code, datasheets/reference manuals, extracted firmware filesystems, device trees, SVD/IP-XACT/SystemRDL/regfiles, generated headers, or runtime register dumps.

The output is a markdown register/function specification for the modeling skill. This flow does not produce QEMU source code.

## Hard policy boundary

Do not produce source code intended for QEMU upstream submission. QEMU currently declines contributions believed to include or derive from AI-generated content. This flow is research and analysis only. Do not add `Signed-off-by`, `Reviewed-by`, `Acked-by`, `Tested-by`, or similar contribution trailers.

## Artifact root rule

All generated artifacts must stay under the task workspace from `qemu-flow-plan`:

```text
build/agent/<task-slug>/
```

Recommended files:

```text
build/agent/<task-slug>/
  register-extraction.md
  source-inventory.md
  conflicts.md
  evidence.md
  logs/
  scratch/
```

Never write notes, converted datasheet excerpts, extracted filesystem files, generated tables, or scratch scripts into QEMU source directories.

## Required inputs

Record every input source in `source-inventory.md`:

- driver source path, repository URL, branch/commit, OS/project, and version;
- datasheet/reference manual title, revision, date, page/section, and errata source;
- firmware filesystem or image path, hash, extraction method, and relevant files;
- device tree/DTS/DTB paths and node names;
- regfile format and path, such as SVD, IP-XACT, SystemRDL, CSV, JSON, YAML, XML, vendor headers, or generated register descriptions;
- runtime dumps or traces, including command, image hash, and capture path.

If a source is proprietary or large, summarize technical facts and cite location. Do not paste large copyrighted sections into the markdown.

## Extraction order

### 1. Identify device variants

Extract:

- block name, vendor name, aliases, and IP version;
- SoC/board variants and compatibility strings;
- register-window count, base addresses, sizes, and endianness;
- bus type and access width requirements;
- clock, reset, power-domain, and pinctrl dependencies;
- interrupt lines and interrupt-controller source numbers;
- DMA channels, stream endpoints, or bus-master capability.

### 2. Build the source cross-reference

For each register or behavior, note which source mentions it:

- datasheet table or section;
- driver macro/header;
- driver read/write path;
- firmware initialization sequence;
- device tree property;
- regfile field;
- runtime trace or dump.

Use source paths and line/page references. When two sources disagree, do not choose silently; record the conflict in `conflicts.md`.

### 3. Extract register facts

For each register, extract:

- offset and width;
- reset value;
- access type: RO, WO, RW, W1C, W1S, clear-on-read, write-only trigger, read-side effect;
- reserved bits and unimplemented bits;
- bitfield name, shift, width, mask, and enumerated values;
- aliasing, banked registers, indexed windows, FIFOs, or shadow registers;
- valid access sizes and alignment behavior;
- behavior on unsupported access size or unknown offset.

Keep numeric values in hex where hardware docs use hex. Normalize units and bit numbering.

### 4. Extract behavior, not only registers

Driver code often reveals semantics absent from datasheets. Extract:

- initialization sequence and required ordering;
- reset/unlock/lock sequences;
- polling loops and timeout conditions;
- IRQ enable, mask, status, clear, and acknowledge flow;
- timer/counter progression and clock dependency;
- DMA descriptor layout, ownership bits, completion status, and error paths;
- FIFO push/pop semantics and overflow/underflow behavior;
- command-stream format for accelerator-like blocks;
- required delays, busy bits, and self-clearing bits;
- feature-detection registers and version-dependent behavior;
- multi-register feature-enable conditions, where a feature works only when specific bits across control, mode, mask, status, clock, reset, descriptor, or threshold registers are combined correctly.

Do not assume a register is passive because it is a scalar field. Check driver call paths around every write with side effects.

### 5. Analyze cross-register dependencies

Many peripherals expose features that are not represented by a single register. Extract the dependency graph between registers and bitfields whenever software combines them.

Look for:

- enable chains, such as clock gate plus reset release plus mode enable plus start bit;
- IRQ paths, such as raw status plus mask/enable plus global interrupt enable plus W1C acknowledge;
- DMA paths, such as source/destination address registers plus length plus control bits plus descriptor ownership plus completion status;
- FIFO or threshold behavior, such as depth, watermark, interrupt enable, push/pop side effects, and overflow status;
- timer/counter behavior, such as load value plus prescaler plus enable plus auto-reload plus status clear;
- lock/unlock or write-protect sequences affecting later writes to other registers;
- mode-dependent interpretation where one register changes the meaning or valid bits of another;
- bank select, index/data, page select, or window registers controlling which logical register is accessed;
- reset dependencies where one bit resets multiple registers or where reset completion is observed through another register;
- feature-detection bits that gate whether other registers or fields exist.

For each dependency, record:

- participating registers and bitfields;
- required order of operations;
- whether the dependency is level, edge, latch, write-trigger, self-clearing, or polling-based;
- what happens when only part of the dependency is satisfied;
- driver function or datasheet section proving the relationship;
- qtest candidate that exercises the complete feature path, not only individual fields.

Represent dependencies as named feature flows, not just prose attached to one register. This lets the downstream modeling skill decide which QEMU registerinfo hooks need to coordinate multiple register values.

### 6. Use driver search patterns

Search drivers by symbol and behavior, not only file names:

- compatible strings and device names;
- register macro prefixes;
- base-address constants;
- IRQ names and status bit names;
- reset/clock names;
- polling helpers and timeout loops;
- read/write helper wrappers;
- probe/init/remove/reset/suspend/resume paths;
- firmware boot or board init code;
- generated headers imported by the driver.

For Linux-like trees, inspect driver, binding schema, DTS nodes, reset/clock providers, and subsystem helpers. For U-Boot, TF-A, EDK2, Zephyr, RTOS, and bare-metal SDKs, inspect board init plus low-level HAL accessors.

### 7. Use filesystem and firmware evidence

For extracted firmware filesystems or runtime captures, look for:

- `/proc/device-tree` or decompiled DTB equivalents;
- kernel modules and module parameters;
- init scripts that configure the device;
- firmware blobs loaded into the device;
- config files naming MMIO bases, IRQs, clocks, or DMA buffers;
- logs showing initialization order or failure markers;
- userspace tools that poke registers directly.

Store extracted or copied artifacts under `build/agent/<task-slug>/scratch/` only.

### 8. Convert regfiles carefully

For SVD/IP-XACT/SystemRDL/vendor regfiles:

- preserve register grouping and arrays;
- verify address-unit assumptions;
- verify reset values and access policies against drivers;
- extract enumerated field values;
- mark fields present in regfile but unused by software;
- mark driver-used fields missing from regfile.

Generated headers are evidence, not authority. Cross-check them against the manual or driver behavior.

## Confidence and conflict policy

Assign each extracted fact one confidence level:

- **HIGH**: datasheet/regfile and driver agree, or runtime confirms behavior.
- **MEDIUM**: one strong source exists, but no independent confirmation.
- **LOW**: inferred from naming, nearby code, or incomplete traces.
- **CONFLICT**: sources disagree.

For conflicts, record:

- exact conflicting sources;
- the values/semantics that differ;
- which source is newer or closer to the target workload;
- what qtest/runtime check would resolve it;
- chosen modeling assumption, if one is necessary.

## Handoff Checklist for qemu-peripheral-modeling
```

Do not include C code templates. The downstream modeling skill must inspect the checked-out QEMU registerinfo API and choose the implementation details.

## Handoff requirements

Before handing off to `qemu-peripheral-modeling`, ensure the markdown contains:

- all known register offsets and fields;
- access semantics for every software-touched register;
- reset values or explicit unknowns;
- side-effect registers requiring pre-write, post-write, or post-read hooks;
- cross-register dependencies and feature flows involving multiple registers or bitfields;
- IRQ/status clear behavior;
- DMA/FIFO/timer/command semantics when present;
- qtest candidates for reset, masks, W1C, IRQ, timer, DMA, cross-register feature enablement, and unknown-offset behavior;
- unresolved conflicts with source references.

If any of these are missing, mark the gap explicitly. Do not hide unknowns by inventing defaults.
